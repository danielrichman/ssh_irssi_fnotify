fnotify has existed for a while, and is a plugin for irssi that writes any 
text with the HILIGHT flag set to a file so that it may be picked up by an
external program and then forwarded on to whatever notification system is 
appropriate.

ssh_irssi_fnotify starts a ssh process, using tail -f to collect lines written
to the file, and fires of a notice (via libnotify) whenever a hilighted 
message is received. It also creates an irssi-icon in the notification area,
which will turn blue when a hilighted message is received. This "flag" can
be "reset" to clear by clicking on it.

  INSTALLATION
===============================================================================

Building ssh_irssi_fnotify requires libnotify-dev and libgtk2.0-dev.
Run make to get started!

Personally I just install the resulting binary (which has the png files 
compiled in so can operate totally stand-alone) to ~/.ssh_irssi_fnotify and
start it automatically using gnome autostart (copy the included .desktop
file to ~/.config/autostart after editing the ssh-server-name). 
I use ssh-agent and settings in my ssh_config to have this all automated.

===============================================================================
  TODO
===============================================================================

 * Automatic reset of icon when messages in irssi are viewed
 * Have a queue that is emptied by ssh_irssi_fnotify, thereby allowing
   hilights from time spent detached/offline to be displayed when
   reconnecting. This would also solve the next TODO:
 * Avoid using a file (which keeps growing) to communicate with irssi
 * Configuration file & a GUI for this.
 * Watch out incase the ssh child dies.

===============================================================================
  COMPLETED TODOS
===============================================================================

 * Fix thread safety: it *still* segfaults :X -- Done
